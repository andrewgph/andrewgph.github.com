<p>
During my time as a postgraduate researcher I investigated difficult conceptual problems in
the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Informatics, Philosophy and Law. My thesis addressed the
problem of providing automated support for the evolution of legal knowledge.

As a researcher I participated in the following activities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing a dissertation and workshop papers</li>
<li>Presenting posters and papers at workshops</li>
<li>Presenting and discussing ideas at seminars</li>
<li>Reviewing papers</li>
<li>Organising talks</li>
</ul>
