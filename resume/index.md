<p>
My goal is to engineer software systems that process the information our society depends upon. I've studied a variety of academic subjects, including Mathematics, Computer Science, Philosophy and Law, and I've gained technical experience from working on complex software systems in the online gambling industry. These experiences allow me to quickly understand and work on software systems in different domains.
</p>
<p>
I have a passion for technically demanding work. I'm continually working to improve my skill-set, for example I've recently taken several <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> courses and my <a href="https://github.com/andrewgph">GitHub account</a> has examples of side projects that I've worked on.
</p>

In my time at OpenBet I have worked with some of the largest companies in the gambling industry on technically challenging projects. In particular I was involved in projects to add live sports betting functionality to the William Hill sportsbook, <a href="http://sports.williamhill.com/bet">sports.williamhill.com/bet</a>, and to develop a sportsbook for BCLC, <a href="http://www.playnow.com/sports">www.playnow.com/sports</a>. I was assigned to the William Hill live betting project shortly after joining OpenBet and was heavily involved in developing the complex functionality to tight deadlines. I was involved in the BCLC sportsbook project through all stages of the software development lifecycle, from the initial workshops in February 2011 through to the successful launch in July 2012.
