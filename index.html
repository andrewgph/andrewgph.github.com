</h4>

<p>
  I'm working within the Forecasting org. My team works on generating forecasts for new products at Amazon. Our technology stack is based upon AWS EMR & EC2, Scala, Apache Spark, Python, Keras, MXNet and C++ with Random Forecast and Neural Network Machine Learning models.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lead Software Engineer for a team of 10 Engineers.</li>
  <li>Team runs over 50 EMR clusters daily, collectively using over 1000 EC2 instances and processing 35 TBs of data to generate forecasts for 11 Amazon marketplaces.</li>
  <li>Led the migration of team applications from Hadoop MapReduce jobs running on a legacy shared cluster to EMR and Apache Spark. This allowed us to scale up our experiments, previously capped to the capacity on the shared cluster, and significantly improved the application development experience. 10x increase to the number of experiments we could run and 52x increase to the scale of the experiments.</li>
  <li>Designed and implemented experimentation tools used by Engineers and Scientists.</li>
  <li>Launched several new models for different Forecasting scenarios, in particular for Softlines items. Working closely with Research Scientists to develop and backtest the model before launching in production.</li>
