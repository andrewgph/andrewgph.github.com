<p>
My goal is to engineer software systems that process the information our society depends upon. I've studied a variety of academic subjects, including Mathematics, Computer Science, Philosophy and Law, and I've gained technical experience from working on complex software systems in online gambling and e-commerce. These experiences allow me to quickly understand and work on software systems in different domains.
</p>
<p>
I have a passion for technically demanding work. I'm continually working to improve my skill-set, for example I've recently taken several <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> courses and my <a href="https://github.com/andrewgph">GitHub account</a> has examples of side projects that I've worked on.
